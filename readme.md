### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Practised positioning techniques, haven't had the opportunity to work with these much yet.

### Continued development

- SVG scaling - treated SVGs like images which wasn't as effective as it would have been had I used SVG tags. Encountered some scaling issues on the icons, need to address the knowledge gap.
- Feel like my code could be more organised, need to make better use of global styles and the cascade.
